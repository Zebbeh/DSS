# DSS

Used this dataset for the project: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/mobile-device-usage-and-user-behavior-dataset

If you want to test the stramlit user interface you need to have have a virtual environment. I used conda to create the environment.


You need to download the dataset and put it in a folder called data under src.

You also need to install different packages for the app to work.

```pip install streamlit pandas sklearn```


Then you need to run the streamlit app from the folder that the python app is located with the following command: ```streamlit run dss_app.py```
